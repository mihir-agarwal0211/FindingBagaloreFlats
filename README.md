# FindingBagaloreFlats

This Project was made when i was searching for flats to rent in Bangalore. The program takes the contact info of 140 brokers and generate a VCF file using `GenerateVCFfile.py` through which you can save the contacts. You can then use `sendmessageFinal.py` to send a personalised message to all of them through automation
